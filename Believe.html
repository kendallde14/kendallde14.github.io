<P> I believe everyone should be healthy. In order for one to become healthy they have to eating the right food and portions, exercising daily, and get the right amount of sleep every night. If one does this they will improve their overall health, physical capabilities, and brain function/mood. </P>

<P> I also strongly believe in our zodiac signs. There are 12 zodiac signs, and each sign has its own strengths and weaknesses, its own specific traits, desires and attitude towards life and people. By analyzing the projection of the position of planets, and the Sun and the Moon on the Ecliptic at the moment of birth. Astrology can give us a glimpse of a person's basic characteristics, preferences, flaws and fears. For example I am a sagittarius and their strengths are;  Generous, idealistic, and great sense of humor; weaknesses are; Promises more than can deliver, very impatient, and will say anything no matter how undiplomatic (brutally honest). Sagittarius typically like; Freedom, travel, philosophy, and being outdoors and they dislike; Clingy people, being constrained, off-the-wall theories, and details. Just by reading what you have read about me you can see why I like what I like. By reading and understanding Zodiac signs I have not only been able to understand myself more but other people. Find out your zodiac sign now! </P>

<P> Like I said I do not think the way we live is not the right way to live. I do not know what the necessary right way to live is but all I know many is that a lot of American families live lavishly while majority of people could never come close to the way we live. I also know that our climate is changing because of the way we live. I also know our meat/dairy industries are not ethically correct. I encourage you to watch what the health on Netflix and food inc to inform yourself what you are putting into your mouth and allowing your body to digest. I also know the number one leading cause of deaths in America is hear disease, then cancer, and then stroke, which all are caused by your health. </P>
