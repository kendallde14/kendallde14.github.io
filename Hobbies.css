<P> I love running! I started running when I was a freshman in high school. Ever since then running is my favorite way to get exercise. I try to run everyday for at least 30-60 minutes. I prefer to run outside than a treadmill because it distracts me and I feel like i am in a video game. You can say I get the runners high. </P>

<P> As I said before I nature so naturally I love hiking. I do not get to hike as much as I would like to but when I am older i plan to live in the woods and hike as much as I can. </P>

<P> I love all my friends and I am grateful that they love me for me. It makes me happy when my friends and people around me are happy so I try my hardest to put a smile on everyones faces. </P>
